      <div className="">
        I am very involved with the breed and am a performance AKC judge. My
        dogs are Master Hunters and Field Trial Champions that have competed in
        both the Open and Amateur National Fiel Trials. I strive to not only
        produce beautiful puppies and continue my line, but to help promote
        responsible breeding in order to ensure that the English Springer
        Spaniel will continue to thrive for generations to come.

      <div className="font-bold">How we started</div>
      <div>
        A consistent love for the field bred ESS, along with hunting and
        training my own dogs encouraged the beginning of Bean Sidhe Springers.
        It is an honor to represent this breed and create opportunities for
        others to experience the same joy that l've found in raising these
        wonderful dogs.

      <div className="font-bold">What makes our dogs special </div>
      <div>I breed healthy, top-quality puppies for the upland hunter or trial
home. I do not breed my dogs until they are fully health and
genetically tested. I am dedicated to always having responsible
policies when it comes to breeding, socializing, and training my
pups. I have also introduced Irish bred, IKC Registered rough
shooting dogs to my lines that are noted for their ability to spend
hours working in heavy cover. I have love what I do and truly want
the very best for my puppies and their forever families.</div>
